## Comments

I found a good use of the INSERT key. Instead of manually typing letter equivalents for paragraphs of EEEEE EE EEEEE, E and so on, INSERT + Right arrow key (or SPACE) makes the job so much easier. I still can't find any other major use for the insert key in my workflow, but this came close
